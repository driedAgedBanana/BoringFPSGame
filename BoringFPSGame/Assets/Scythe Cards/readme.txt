Instructions:

Scythe Cards is a simple and barebones subtitle system that takes advantage
of Unity's Scriptable Object Workflow to allow game developers to add
accessibility options quickly, easily and fast.

Simply drop the Subtitle Manager prefab into your scene, create a subtitle card, reference it, call the method and it's done!

It's easily accomplished via the prefabbed manager, a scriptable object that contains your dialogue and timing, and just calling the method.
For a full explanation please see the barebones 'Example Scene' and review the code and tooltips to understand better.
